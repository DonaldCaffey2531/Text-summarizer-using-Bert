# Text Summarizer with Transformers

Build an intelligent text summarizer that automatically generates concise and informative summaries from long documents, articles, or web pages. Leverage state-of-the-art transformer models (like BERT, T5, or BART) to perform either extractive or abstractive summarization.

## Features
- Input long-form text or documents
- Get concise summaries
- Choose summary length
- CLI and web interface

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python app.py`

## Technologies & Tools
Python (PyTorch or TensorFlow)
Hugging Face Transformers library
Streamlit or Flask for UI (optional)
NLTK or spaCy (for preprocessing)
Docker (for deployment)

## Suggested Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Clean and tokenize input text.
Model Selection
Use pre-trained models (e.g., facebook/bart-large-cnn, t5-base).
Summarization Pipeline
Implement both extractive (select key sentences) and abstractive (generate new sentences) approaches.
User Interface
Build a simple web or CLI app for users to upload text and receive summaries.
Evaluation
Measure summary quality with metrics like ROUGE and BLEU.
Deployment
Containerize and deploy the application.
